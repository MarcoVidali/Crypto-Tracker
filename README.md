# Crypto Tracker
## What is Crypto Tracker?
Crypto Tracker is a program that allows you to track the price of cryptos in real time.
## How can I use it?
Simply, run the "Crypto Tracker.exe" file. If you want to close the program, simply press "CTRL + C". Then, choose a crypto to track (writing the number of the crypto). The current price of the crypto will be displayed on the screen. It will update automatically the crypto price. If the price is green, the price is levitating, elsewise it's going down.
